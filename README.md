This repository contains only a `README.md` file. Its purpose is to store work related to [Tai-e](https://github.com/pascal-lab/Tai-e) â€” specifically, the [Cut-Shortcut](https://doi.org/10.1145/3591242). Comprehensive details are available in the [PLDI 2023 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3591242). For instructions on reproducing the results detailed in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3591242), refer to the documentation within the [artifact](https://zenodo.org/records/7808384).


> **Note**
> 
> This repository will be either archived or deleted once Cut-Shortcut is officially re-implemented and integrated upon the latest version of ([Tai-e#62](https://github.com/pascal-lab/Tai-e/issues/62)).
